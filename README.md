## Goal
Given a grid of integer numbers, the scope of the game is to find the concatenated path to obtain the best possible sum, among all the possible combinations.
The game could be played in quick match, with auto-generated grids on several difficulty levels, or on arcade mode, with hundreds of pre-solved levels with an increasing difficulty.
Another variable is the direction of the paths. The player can decide to play with only vertical and horizontal paths or to include the diagonals too (increasing the difficulty).
